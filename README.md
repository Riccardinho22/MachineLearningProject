# Machine learning in medicine
The dataset, called RISPEVA and registered by 21 institutions in Italy, is made up of 3507 instances and 138 different features, both real-valued and binary, that contain information about the medical overview of patients. The task we propose is to give predictions on two different binary classification tasks: whether the procedure has or not success, and whether the patient would survive over a month.

The information about perfomance are in medical_predictions.ipynb, whereas inside folders ProjectML/monthDeath and ProjectML/proceduralSuccess are located all code's project.
